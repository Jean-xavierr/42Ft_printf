# Ft_printf - @42Born2Code
Recoder la fonction printf en C / Recode the printf function in C 

## What is the ft_printf ?
Ft_printf is an individual project at 42 where we have to recode the printf function in C.

This project aims to make us understand the printf algorithm, to learn how to manage an indefinite number of arguments with the stdarg library.

We have to manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%.

As well as the following flags: -0. *.

## To do list

*When I have time, fix leaks and improve the program*

- [ ] Fix leaks `%d %u %x %X %p` (leaks in `ft_display_management(t_data *data)`)
- [ ] Add free() in ft_strjoin.c
- [ ] Improve and restructure the code
